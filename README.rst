BuildGrid is a Python remote execution service which implements Google's
`Remote Execution API`_ and the `Remote Workers API`_. The project's goal is to
be able to execute build jobs remotely on a grid of computers in order to
massively speed up build times. Workers on the grid should be able to run with
different environments. It is designed to work with but not exclusively
`BuildStream`_.
