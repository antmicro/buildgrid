What is BuildGrid?
------------------

BuildGrid is a Python remote execution service which implements Google's
`Remote Execution API`_ and the `Remote Workers API`_. The project's goal is to
be able to execute build jobs remotely on a grid of computers in order to
massively speed up build times. Workers on the grid should be able to run with
different environments. It works with clients such as `Bazel`_, 
`BuildStream`_ and `RECC`_, and is designed to be able to work with any client
that conforms to the above API protocols.
